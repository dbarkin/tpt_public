-- the small_orders table below is a table with one order only (for demo purposes,
-- so that scanning the large orders_table wouldn't affect measurements). The idea
-- is to demonstrate that even without any direct filter predicates against the "fact"
-- table ORDER_ITEMS, the bloom filter min/max values can also be used for avoiding IO
-- with storage indexes.
--
-- You can create your SMALL_ORDERS table (from SwingBench Order Entry SOE schema):
--   CREATE TABLE soe.small_orders AS SELECT * FROM soe.orders WHERE rownum = 1;
--

SELECT /*+ MONITOR LEADING(o) FULL(o) FULL(oi) PARALLEL(4) PX_JOIN_FILTER(oi) */
    o.*
  , oi.*
FROM
    soe.small_orders o -- one row only
  , soe.order_items oi
WHERE
-- join conditions
    o.order_id    = oi.order_id
