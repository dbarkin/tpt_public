-- Purpose:     Advanced Oracle Troubleshooting Seminar demo script
--              Depending on the speed of LGWR IO will cause the session to wait
--              for log buffer space and log switch wait events (demo works
--              ok on a single hard disk laptop, probably will not wait so much
--              on a server with write cached storage)
